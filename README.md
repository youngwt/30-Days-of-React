# 30 days of react

This is a project to document learning for a crash course in React

It is based on the book "30 Days of React" from FullStack.io

## Lesson 1

Lesson one covered the basic introduction to React and its reliance on the concept of the virtual DOM.

## Lesson 2

Lesson two introduced the concept of extending Javascript to represent HTML, and how this can be written in ECMAScript 6 and then transpiled to ECMAScript 5.

## Lesson 3

In Lesson three I created my first React Component, a simple H1 tag with Hello World. I took the latest libraries from the React website and used the example in the book. At first I omitted the babel library to see if it is needed in my environment. I ran the code using the live preview of Brackets.io which served the page in chrome. On first try it did not work. Including the script tag for babel resolved this issue.
